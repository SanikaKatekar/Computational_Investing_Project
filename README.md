## Title: Intrinsic Value Analysis using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

## Project Overview
1. Conducted a sector-wise analysis of stocks to identify potential value investing opportunities, resulting in the
identification of 8 undervalued stocks with an average intrinsic value of 20% higher than their current market price.
2. Compared two approaches for finding intrinsic value using the Discounted Cash Flow method, one using a
traditional calculation-based approach and the other using a machine learning algorithm (linear regression).
3. Utilized problem-solving skills and critical thinking to analyze and compare the results of the two approaches and
identify the reasons for the drawbacks of the machine learning model.
