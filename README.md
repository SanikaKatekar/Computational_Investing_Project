## Title: Intrinsic Value Analysis using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

## Project 
1. Conducted a sector-wise analysis of stocks to identify potential value investing opportunities, resulting in the
identification of 8 undervalued stocks with an average intrinsic value of 20% higher than their current market price.
2. Compared two approaches for finding intrinsic value using the Discounted Cash Flow method, one using a
traditional calculation-based approach and the other using a machine learning algorithm (linear regression).
3. Utilized problem-solving skills and critical thinking to analyze and compare the results of the two approaches and
identify the reasons for the drawbacks of the machine learning model.

## Project Overview

Intrinsic value is a key concept in investing, as it represents the true value of a company's stock, independent of its market price. It is based on a number of factors, including the company's future earnings potential, growth prospects, and risks. This project is divided into two parts. This project was developed to compare efficient approaches of finding the intrinsic value using the discounted cash flow analysis. The second part of this project focused on conducting a sector-wise analysis of stocks for intrinsic value to see which sector could potentially form a part of a value investing portfolio. Also, this part helps us visualize the distribution of stocks according to value investors within a sector as well as across sectors. 

## Approach

This project has been approached by dividing the projects into two parts. The first part focuses on comparing two approaches of implementing the Discount Cash Flow analysis to find the intrinsic value of a stock. Out of the two approaches, one uses machine learning while the other does not. 
One method of finding intrinsic value is to use a more traditional approach, such as the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. This approach involves estimating the company's future cash flows, discounting them to the present value, and then adjusting for risks and growth prospects to arrive at an intrinsic value estimate. For this project, I compared the intrinsic value obtained from variations of the DCF method. The first approach uses the above-mentioned traditional way of discount cash flow analysis. This method heavily depends on explicitly specified assumptions and calculations. 

Another variation of the DCF method for finding intrinsic value is to use a machine learning algorithm to predict future cash flows instead of following the traditional calculation-based prediction. This approach involves training a model on historical data, such as the company's previous years cash flows. The model is then able to make predictions about the company's future cash flows, which can be used to estimate its intrinsic value. 
The machine learning algorithm that is implemented is the Linear Regression from sklearn. The choice for linear regression arose from the fact that cash flows show a linearly increasing trend a lot of the times and hence the linear regression model would be able to fit the data well.
